# PyGo

New but similar language programming.
Now we are capable to program in a very similar language to Python but at the same time get the efficiency of Go.

The system has a custom interpreter capable to launch like a Python terminal (with no speed improvement).
Also it is capable to translate the code to Go and then compile it. Here is where we get the improvement.

This system wants to be as easy to program as Python, almost looking equals to Python, therefore it should be 
relatively easy to translate your existing project from Python to PyGo.

At the same time, since the project translates to Go, any library or project already developped in Go must be
compatible and directly imported with PyGo.

This is the union of the two best worlds: Readability and fast programming (Python) with fast execution code (Go).

## Note

This project is under development.
